            "content=\"**Endurance Customer Journey Test Summary**\\n\\n**Objective:** To test the performance and functionality of a set-top box (STB) over a 24-hour period, simulating a customer's typical usage journey.\\n\\n**Test Script:**\\n\\n1. Launch a series of customer journey scripts on the VSB in a loop for 24 hours, covering various scenarios such as:\\n\\t* Netflix, Live + timeshift, VOD, GVA, Zapping, Youtube, Standby/Wake up, Navigation on Settings menu, EPG, Amazon Prime Video, and Disney+.\\n2. Perform specific actions within each scenario, such as searching for content, playing videos, changing volume, and using trick modes.\\n\\n**Expected Results:**\\n\\n1. No low performance should be observed after 24 hours of testing.\\n2. All menus and features should be displayed correctly and function as expected.\\n3. Uptime should be in conformance with the time the STB was started for the test.\\n4. RCU information (battery level, Firmware version) should be accurate.\\n5. Google Assistant should respond correctly.\\n6. No WiFi disconnections should occur during the test.\\n7. BPE callback time should be within the expected range (random value between 0 and 60 minutes, or default value of 5 minutes).\\n\\n**Recommendations:**\\n\\n1. Ensure that the STB is properly configured and updated before starting the test.\\n2. Monitor the test progress and logs to identify any issues or anomalies.\\n3. Verify that the test script covers all the required scenarios and actions.\\n4. Perform a thorough analysis of the test results to identify any areas for improvement.\\n5. Consider running the test multiple times to ensure consistent results.\\n\\nBy following this test script and expected results, you can ensure that your STB is thoroughly tested and meets the required performance and functionality standards.\" additional_kwargs={} response_metadata={'token_usage': {'completion_tokens': 376, 'prompt_tokens': 1307, 'total_tokens': 1683, 'completion_time': 1.504, 'prompt_time': 0.223849529, 'queue_time': 0.0037409409999999976, 'total_time': 1.727849529}, 'model_name': 'llama-3.1-70b-versatile', 'system_fingerprint': 'fp_5c5d1b5cfb', 'finish_reason': 'stop', 'logprobs': None} id='run-6c27dcf4-388f-4be7-82a4-4c6597d72403-0' usage_metadata={'input_tokens': 1307, 'output_tokens': 376, 'total_tokens': 1683}\n",
